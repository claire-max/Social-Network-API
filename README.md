  ## Description
This challenge is to build an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends’ thoughts, and create a friend list. You’ll use Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM. In addition to using the Express.js and Mongoose packages you may also optionally use a JavaScript date library of your choice or the native JavaScript Date object to format timestamps.


  ## Installation
  1. Create Social Media Network repo.
  2. Install dependencies using "npm install" 
  3. Connect to MongoDB Compass database:
  * Start the server
  ```$ npm start```
  4. Now you are ready to use on Insomnia!
